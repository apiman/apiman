# The Apiman project (Open Source API Management)

ðŸ’¡ Apiman 3 is under very active development. You can find it on the [3.x branch](https://github.com/apiman/apiman/tree/3.x).
We hope to do our first release very soon.

## Summary

This is the official Git repository for the apiman project:  http://apiman.io/

The apiman project is a standalone API Management system that can be either run as a separate system or
embedded within existing frameworks and platforms.

## Get the code

The easiest way to get started with the code is to [create your own fork](http://help.github.com/forking/)
of this repository, and then clone your fork:

	$ git clone git@github.com:<you>/apiman.git
	$ cd apiman
	$ git remote add upstream git://github.com/apiman/apiman.git

At any time, you can pull changes from the upstream and merge them onto your master:

	$ git checkout master               # switches to the 'master' branch
	$ git fetch upstream                # fetch upstream
	$ git rebase upstream/master        # replay your commits on top of master; you could use 'merge' if you want.
	$ git push origin                   # pushes all the updates to your fork, which should be in-sync with 'upstream'

The general idea is to keep your 'master' branch in-sync with the 'upstream/master'.

## Building apiman

### Requirements
- Maven 3.x (you can use Maven wrapper `mvnw` script to ensure you have an appropriate version of Maven available)
- Java 8+ (your application server must also support the version of Java you intend to deploy on)
- Docker (for running tests with [testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/supported_docker_environment/))

The following command compiles all the code, installs the JARs into your local Maven repository, and runs all of the unit tests:

	$ ./mvnw clean install
	
You can skip the tests if you do not have docker installed:

	$ ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests

## Quickstart (i.e. How To Run It)

The project can be built and deployed on a variety of runtime platforms, but if you want to see it in
action as quickly as possible try this:

	$ ./mvnw clean install -Pinstall-all-wildfly
        $ cd tools/server-all/target/wildfly-dev-server
        $ ./bin/standalone.sh

The commands above will do the following:

1. A full build of apiman
2. Download WildFly
3. Unpack and configure WildFly
4. Deploy the WildFly version of Apiman to WildFly

Once WildFly has started up, and if all went well, you can point your browser to the
[API Manager](http://localhost:8080/apimanui/) and log in (either register a new user
or log in as the admin):

* `admin`/`admin123!`

Note that this quickstart seeds a bunch of content into apiman. This is not strictly necessary, but it
does populate the API Manager with some data so that it doesn't feel so lonely the first time you log in.
You're welcome.

## Contribute fixes and features

Apiman is open source, and we welcome anybody who wants to participate and contribute!

If you want to fix a bug or make any changes, please log an issue in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/apiman/apiman/issues) describing the bug or new feature. 

There are [lots of different workflows for contributing](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request), and everyone has their own preferred way. But here's one method we recommend:

- Create a personal fork of Apiman (e.g. in the GitHub UI via the 'fork' button)
- Clone your fork onto your development machine, e.g: `git clone git@github.com:apiman/apiman.git`
- Add the Apiman upstream as a remote, e.g: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/apiman/apiman.git`

Then we highly recommend making the changes on a topic branch named with the GitHub issue number. For example, this command creates
a branch for the #317 issue:
	
	$ git checkout -b apiman-317

After you're happy with your changes and a full build (with unit tests) runs successfully, commit your
changes on your topic branch. 

We use the popular [conventional commit standard for commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
       

Then it's time to check for and pull any recent changes that were made in
the official repository:

	$ git fetch --all                # fetches all latest changes
	$ git rebase upstream/master     # reapplies your changes on top of the latest in master
	                                   (i.e., the latest from master will be the new base for your changes)
	$ git push origin                # push your topic branch to your fork
					
You can then [generate a pull-request](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) for your changes.

In general, we will either rebase or squash merge your commit, depending on which is more appropriate (we prefer one commit per distinct feature or issue).

## Code Formatting

When you are hacking on some apiman code, we'd really appreciate it if you followed the
apiman coding standards.  If you're using Eclipse, you can find a code formatter config
file here:

tools/src/eclipse/apiman-eclipse-formatter.xml

You should be able to import that guy straight into Eclipse by going to
*Window->Preferences :: Java/Code Style/Formatter*

## Developer Portal

Apiman also comes with a developer portal. There you can allow developers to access your APIs. Developers can view and test your APIs to develop their own apps.\

api-contracts=API Contracts
api-contracts-help=Here is a list of all contracts between all Client Apps and this API. This provides a list of all Client Apps that may potentially consume this API.
api-def=API Definition
api-def-explanation=Here you can (optionally) provide definition information about your API. This information should take the form of a Swagger API definition file. Adding a definition file will allow consumers to better understand how to use your API. Simply copy/paste (or drag and drop!) your Swagger API definition into the text area below.
api-def.choose-type.title=Choose a type...
api-definition=API Definition
api-definition-label=API Definition:
api-details=API Details
api-endpoint-label=API Endpoint:
api-impl=API Implementation
api-impl-explanation=Please provide us with details about the back-end API implementation so that the API Gateway can successfully proxy API requests. Please include any security you wish to enable between the API Gateway and the back-end API.
api-impl-gateway-explanation=There are multiple API Gateways configured - you'll need to tell us which one you want to use for this API.
api-impl-new-gateway-explanation=An API Gateway has been added since this API was created. The new Gateway has been selected for you - all you need to do is click Save below to make it stick.
api-impl-no-gateways-explanation=There are no API Gateways configured in apiman. For this reason you will not be able to complete the configuration of your API. Please contact your apiman administrator - at least one API Gateway must be configured!
api-impl.choose-content-type.placeholder=Choose a content type...
api-impl.choose-type.placeholder=Choose a type...
api-impl.mtsl-info=When using MTLS/Two-Way-SSL you must configure the relevant settings globally in the apiman.properties file. Please refer to the apiman Installation Guide for details.
api-impl.parse-payload-info=Note that enabling this option may result in additional performance overhead. However, this feature is sometimes required for certain policies to work (in particular many SOAP policies).
api-metrics=API Metrics
api-metrics-explanation=Now that this API is published to the gateway, it *may* be consumed by API clients. Use this tab to view basic metrics/analytics for the API.
api-metrics.show=Show

api-modified=Modified
api-modified.title=The API has been modified since it was last published!
api-name=API Name
api-overview.activity-description=The 'Change Log' tab shows a history of all the changes made to the API. Essentially it is an audit log.
api-overview.api-description=This is the API details page. Use this page to modify the meta-data, plans, and policies for the API. There is no need to follow the tabs in order, but note that you will need to fill out a minimum amount of data before the API can be published to the Gateway. In particular, the Implementation and Plans tabs are important (more information below).
api-overview.contracts-description=The 'Contracts' tab will show a table of all Client Apps that have created API Contracts to this API. In other words, it shows all of the registered consumers of the API. Note that if the API is marked as "Public", this tab will likely be empty.
api-overview.definition-description=The 'Definition' tab allows you to configure an optional API Definition document for your API. A API Definition is a detailed description of the capabilities of your API (operation names, http verbs, data models). For example, you might add a Swagger spec document as your API Definition.
api-overview.endpoint-description=The 'Endpoint' tab will show you information about how to invoke the API once it is published to the API Gateway.
api-overview.impl-description=The 'Implementation' tab is where you go to configure the details of the real API being managed. This is where you tell apiman where the API is, so that we can actually invoke it at runtime.
api-overview.plans-description=The 'Plans' tab is used to configure which Plans (already defined in the Organization) are available when a Client App wishes to create an API Contract with this API. Optionally, an API can also be marked as "Public", which means that no API Contract is required (the API can be invoked without sending an API Key).
api-overview.policies-description=The 'Policies' tab is where you go if you wish to configure any policies that should be enforced for *all* requests to the API, regardless of which user, Client App, or Plan is being used. In other words, API-level policies.
api-plans.no-locked-plans-found=No locked plans were found in the Organization. Please create and lock at least one plan before attempting to configure them here. Or simply make your APIs "public" using the checkbox above!
api-policies=API Policies
api-policies-help=Here is a list of all Policies defined for this API. These Policies will be applied to all invocations of this API by any Client App, regardless of the Plan used in its Contract.

dash.apis-description=Create, find, or manage APIs. An API is also known as a "Service" - anything that can be invoked remotely by some sort of client application. This platform simply provides a way to turn unmanaged (raw) back-end APIs into "managed" APIs by attaching policies to them.

dash.page-description=Welcome to apiman, open source API management. Use this software to provide various APIs (APIs) to your consumers (Client Apps) through a secure, scalable, and governed Gateway layer.

import-apis.no-matching-apis-found=No matching APIs found - use the search box above to search for APIs by name.
import-apis.overview.choose-plans=Once you have searched for and located the API or APIs you wish to import, the next step is to choose whether these APIs should be "public" or should be offered through one or more of the Plans defined by the Organization.
import-apis.overview.find-apis=The first step in the wizard is to search for and find the APIs you wish to import. The location of this data is dependent on how apiman is configured, but in most cases you will be searching against some sort of registry of real, deployed APIs.
import-apis.overview.import-apis=Finally, you will be shown a list of the choices you made so that you can confirm that you really do want to import the APIs. Once you click "Import" on this last step, each of the APIs you chose will be added to the Organization. Success or failure of each API import will be shown as it happens.
import-apis.overview.overview=Welcome to the Import API(s) wizard. Use this wizard to import APIs from external sources. This is typically much faster than entering all of the API details by hand.

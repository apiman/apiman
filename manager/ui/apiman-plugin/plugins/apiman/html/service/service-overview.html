            <p data-i18n-key="service-description">
              This is the service details page.  Use this page to modify the meta-data, plans, and 
              policies for the service.  There is no need to follow the tabs in order, but note that
              you will need to fill out a minimum amount of data before the service can be published
              to the Gateway.  In particular, the Implementation and Plans tabs are important (more
              information below).
            </p>
            
            <h2 data-i18n-key="impl">Implementation</h2>
            <p data-i18n-key="impl-description">
              The 'Implementation' tab is where you go to configure the details of the real service
              being managed.  This is where you tell apiman where the service is, so that we can 
              actually invoke it at runtime.
            </p>

            <h2 data-i18n-key="plans">Plans</h2>
            <p data-i18n-key="plans-description">
              The 'Plans' tab is used to configure which Plans (already defined in the Organization)
              are available when an Application wishes to create a Service Contract with this 
              Service.  Optionally, a Service can also be marked as "Public", which means that no
              Service Contract is required (the Service can be invoked without sending an API Key).
            </p>
            
            <h2 data-i18n-key="policies">Policies</h2>
            <p data-i18n-key="policies-description">
              The 'Policies' tab is where you go if you wish to configure any policies that should
              be enforced for *all* requests to the Service, regardless of which user, application,
              or plan is being used.  In other words, Service-level policies.
            </p>
            
            <h2 data-i18n-key="contracts">Contracts</h2>
            <p data-i18n-key="contracts-description">
              The 'Contracts' tab will show a table of all Applications that have created Service
              Contracts to this Service.  In other words, it shows all of the registered 
              consumers of the Service.  Note that if the Service is marked as "Public", this tab
              will likely be empty.
            </p>

            <h2 data-i18n-key="endpoint">Endpoint</h2>
            <p data-i18n-key="endpoint-description">
              The 'Endpoint' tab will show you information about how to invoke the Service once
              it is published to the API Gateway.
            </p>

            <h2 data-i18n-key="activity">Activity</h2>
            <p data-i18n-key="activity-description">
              The 'Activity' tab shows a history of all the changes made to the Service.  Essentially
              it is an audit log.

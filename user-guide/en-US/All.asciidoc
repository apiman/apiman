== API Manager
There are two layers to the API management project. There is an API Manager which allows end users to
centrally manage their APIs. Additionally there is an API Gateway which is responsible for applying those
policies to API requests.

The API Manager allows end-users to track, configure, and share APIs with other users. All of this is
accomplished by the end user by logging into the API Manager user interface (or using the API Manager
REST API).

=== Data Model
It is perhaps most important to understand the various entities used by the API Manager, as well as
their relationships with each other.

==== Organizations
The top level container concept within the API management project its called the organization. All other
entities are managed within the scope of an organization.

When users log into the API management system they must be affiliated with one or more organization. Users
can have different roles within that organization allowing them to perform different actions and manage
different entities. Please see the 'User Management' section below for more details on this topic.

What an organization actually represents will depend upon who is using API management. When installed within
a large enterprise, an organization may represent an internal group within IT (for example the HR group).  If
installed in the cloud, an organization might represent an external company or organization.

In any case, an organization is required before the end user can create or consume APIs.

==== Policies
The most important concept in API management is the policy. The policy is the unit of work executed at
runtime in order to implement API governance. All other entities within the API Manager exist in support
of configuring policies and sensibly applying them at runtime.

When a request for an API is made at runtime, a policy chain is created and applied to the inbound request,
prior to proxying that request to the back-end API implementation.  This policy chain consists of policies
configured in the API Manager.

An individual policy consists of a type (e.g. authentication or rate limiting) as well as configuration
details specific to the type and instance of that policy.  Multiple policies can be configured per API
resulting in a policy chain that is applied at runtime.

It is very important to understand that policies can be configured at three different levels within API
management.  Policies can be configured on an API, on a plan, or on a client app. For more details
please see the sections below.

==== Plans
A plan is a set of policies that define a level of service for an API. When an API is consumed it may be
consumed through a plan. Please see the section on 'API Contracts' for more information.

An organization can have multiple plans associated with it. Typically each plan within an organization
consists of the same set of policies but with different configuration details. For example, an organization
might have a Gold plan with a rate limiting policy that restricts consumers to 1000 requests per day. The
same organization may then have a Silver plan which is also configured with a rate limiting policy, but which
restricts consumers to 500 requests per day.

Once a plan has been fully configured (all desired policies added and configured) it must be locked so that
it can be used by APIs.  This is done so that API providers can't change the details of the plan
out from underneath the client app developers who are using it.

==== APIs
An API represents an external API that is being governed by the API management system.  An API consists
of a set of metadata including name and description as well as an external endpoint defining the API
implementation. The external API implementation endpoint includes:

* The type/protocol of the endpoint (e.g. REST or SOAP)
* The endpoint content type (e.g. XML or JSON)
* The endpoint location (URL) so that the API can be properly proxied to at runtime.

In addition, policies can be configured on an API. Typically, the policies applied to APIs are things
like authentication, or caching.  Any policies configured on API will be applied at runtime regardless of the
client app and API contract.  This is why authentication is a common policy to configure at the API
level.

APIs may be offered through one or more plans configured in the same organization. When plans are used,
API consumers (client apps) must consume the API through one of those plans. Please see the section on
'API Contracts' for more information.  Alternatively, an API can simply be marked as "Public", in which
case any client may access the API's managed endpoint without providing an API Key.

Only once an API is fully configured, including its policies, implementation, and plans can it be
published to the Gateway for consumption by client apps.  Once an API has been published, it can only
be changed if it is a "Public" API.  APIs that are offered via Plans are immutable - to change them
you must create a new version.  The reason for this is that API consumers may have created Contracts
with your API, through your Plan.  When they do this, they must agree to some terms and conditions.
It is therefore understood that the terms to which they are agreeing will not change.  However, for
Public APIs, there is no such agreement.  For this reason, you can make changes to Public APIs and
re-publish them at any time.

==== Client Apps
A client app represents a consumer of an API. Typical API consumers are things like mobile applications and
B2B applications. Regardless of the actual implementation, a client app must be added to the
API management system so that Contracts can be created between it and the APIs it wishes to consume.

A client app consists of basic metadata such as name and description.  Policies can also be configured on
a client app, but are optional.

Finally, API Contracts can be created between a client app and the API(s) it wishes to consume.
Once the API Contracts are created, the client app can be registered with the runtime gateway.  Policies
and Contracts can be added/removed at any time.  However, after any changes are made, you must
re-register the client app.

==== API Contracts
An API contract is simply a link between a Client App and an API through a plan offered by that
API. This is the only way that a client app can consume an API. If there are no client apps that
have created API contracts with an API, that API cannot be accessed through the API management
runtime gateway (unless of course the API is "Public").

When an API Contract is created, the system generates a unique API key specific to that contract. All
requests made to the API by a Client App through the API Gateway must include this API key. The API
key is used to create the runtime policy chain from the policies configured on the API, plan, and
client app.

API Contracts can only be created between Client Apps and published APIs which are offered through
at least one Plan.  An API Contract cannot be created between a Client App and a Public API.

==== Policy Chain
A policy chain is an ordered sequence of policies that are applied when a request is made for an API
through the API Gateway. The order that policies are applied is important and is as follows:

. Client App
. Plan
. API

Within these individual sections, the end user can specify the order of the policies.

When a request for an API is received by the API Gateway the policy chain is applied to the request in
the order listed above. If none of the policies fail, the API Gateway will proxy the request to the backend
API implementation.  Once a response is received from the back end API implementation, the policy chain is
then applied in reverse order to that response. This allows each policy to be applied twice, once to the
inbound request and then again to the outbound response.

=== User Management
The API Manager offers user role capabilities at the organization level. Users can be members of
organizations and have specific roles within those organizations. The roles themselves are configurable by
an administrator, and each role provides the user with a set of permissions that determine what actions the
user can take within an organization.

==== New Users
Users must self register with the management UI in order to be given access to an organization or to
create their own organization. In some configurations it is possible that user self registration is
unavailable and instead user information is provided by a standard source of identity such as LDAP.  In
either case, the actions a user can take are determined by that user's role memberships within the context
of an organization.

==== Membership
Users can be members of organizations. All memberships in an organization include the specific roles the
user is granted. It is typically up to the owner of an organization to grant role memberships to the members
of that organization.

==== Roles
Roles determine the capabilities granted a user within the context of the organization. The roles themselves
and the capabilities that those roles grant are configured by system administrators. For example,
administrators would typically configure the following roles:

* Organization Owner
* API Developer
* Client App Developer

Each of these roles is configured by an administrator to provide a specific set of permissions allowing the
user to perform relevant actions appropriate to that role. For example the Client App Developer role would
grant an end user the ability to manage client apps and API contracts for those client apps. However
that user would not be able to create or manage the organization's APIs or plans.

=== Managing Organizations
Before any other actions can be taken an organization must exist. All other operations take place within the
context of an organization.

In order to create an organization click the 'Create a New Organization' link found on the dashboard page
that appears when you first login. Simply provide an organization name and description and then click the
'Create Organization' button.  If successful you will be taken to the organization details page.

If you create multiple organizations, you can see the list of those organizations on your home page. For
example, you may click the 'Go to My Organizations' link from the dashboard page.

=== Managing Plans
Plans must be managed within the scope of an organization.  Once created, plans can be used for any API
defined within that same organization.  To see a list of existing plans for an organization, navigate to the
'Plans' tab for that organization on its details page.

==== Creating a Plan
Plans can be created easily from the 'Plans' tab of the organization details page. Simply click the 'New Plan'
button and then provide a plan name, version, and description. Once that information is provided, click the
'Create Plan' button. If successfully created, you'll be taken to the plan details page.

==== Plan Policies
If you switch to the 'Policies' tab on the plan details page you can configure the list of policies for the
plan. Please note that the order of the policies can be changed and is important. The order that the policies
appear in the user interface determines the order they will be applied at runtime. You can drag a policy up
and down the list to change the order.

To add a policy to the plan click the 'Add Policy' button. On the resulting page choose the type of policy
you wish to create and then configure the details for that policy. Once you have configured the details click
the 'Add Policy' button to add the policy to the plan.

==== Locking the Plan
Once all your plan policies are added and configured the way you want them, you will need to Lock the
plan.  This can be done from any tab of the Plan UI page.  Locking the plan will prevent all future policy
changes, and make the plan available for use by APIs.

=== Providing APIs
A core capability of API management is for end users to create, manage, and configure APIs they wish to
provide. This section explains the steps necessary for users to provide those APIs.

==== Creating an API
First the user must create an API within an organization. If an organization does not yet exist one can
easily be created.  See the 'Managing Organizations' section for details.

From the organization details page, navigate to the 'APIs' tab and click on the 'New API' button. You
will be asked to provide an API name, version number, and description.

If successfully created, you will be taken to the API details page. From here you can configure the
details of the API.

==== API Implementation
Every API must be configured with an API implementation. The implementation indicates the external
API that the API Gateway will proxy to if all the policies are successfully applied. Click the
'Implementation' tab to configure the API endpoint and API type details on your API.

The 'Implementation' tab is primarily used to configure the details of the back-end API that
apiman will proxy to at runtime.  You must configure the following:

* *Endpoint URL* - The URL that apiman will use to proxy a request made for this API.
* *Endpoint Type* - Currently either REST or SOAP (not presently used, future information)
* *Endpoint Content Type* - Choose between JSON and XML, information primarily used to respond with a policy failure or error in the appropriate format.

Additionally, the 'Implementation' tab allows you to configure any security options that might
be required when proxying requests to the back-end API.  For example, if you are using two-way
SSL to ensure full security between the API Gateway and your back-end API, you may configure
that here.  We also support simple BASIC authentication between the gateway and your back end
API.  Please note that BASIC authentication is not ideal, and especially insecure if not
using SSL/HTTPS to connect to the back end API.

If the apiman administrator has configured multiple Gateways (see the "System Administration / Gateways"
section below), then the 'Implementation' tab will also include an option that will let
you choose which Gateway(s) to use when publishing.  You may select one or more Gateway
in this case.  If you choose multiple Gateways, then when you click the 'Publish' button,
apiman will publish the API to *all* of the selected Gateways.

TIP: If a single Gateway has been configured, then you don't have a choice, and so the UI
will hide the Gateway selector entirely and simply pick the default Gateway for you.

Do not forget to click the Save button when you are done making changes.

==== API Definition
As a provider of an API, it is best to include as much information about the API as possible, so
that consumers can not only create contracts, but also learn how to make calls.  For this purpose, you
can optionally include an API Definition document by adding it to your API on the Definition tab.
Currently the only supported type of definition file is Swagger.  Include a swagger spec document here
so that consumers of your API can browse information about your API directly in the API Manager
UI.

==== Available Plans
Before an API can be consumed by a client app, it must make itself available through at least one of
the organization's plans (or it must be marked as "Public"). Marking an API as public or making an API
available through one or more plan can be done by navigating to the 'Plans' tab on the API details page. The
'Plans' tab will list all of the available plans defined by the organization. Simply choose one or more plan
from this list.  If no plans are needed, you can instead mark the API as "Public", making it available to
be consumed anonymously by any client.  Although an API can be *both* Public and available through one or
more plan, it is unusual to do so.

TIP: After you have either marked the API as "public" or selected at least one plan, make sure to click the
Save button.

==== Managing Policies
API policies can be added and configured by navigating to the 'Policies' tab on the API details
page. The 'Policies' tab presents a list of all the policies configured for this API. To add another
policy to the API click the 'Add Policy' button. On the resulting page choose the type of policy you
wish to create and then configure the details for that policy. Once you have configured the details click
the 'Add Policy' button to add the policy to the API.

==== Publishing in the Gateway
After all of the configuration is complete for an API, it is time to publish the API to the runtime
gateway. This can be done from any tab on the API details page by clicking  the 'Publish' button in
the top section of the UI.  If successful, the status of the API will change to "Published" and the
'Publish' button will disappear.

TIP: If the API cannot yet be published (the 'Publish' button is disabled) then a notification will
appear near the button and will read "Why Can't I publish?"  Clicking this notification will provide
details about what information is still required before the API can be published to the Gateway.

Once the API has been published, it may or may not be editable depending on whether it is a "Public"
API or not.  For "Public" APIs, you will be able to continue making changes.  After at least one
change is made, you will have the option to "Re-Publish" the API to the Gateway.  Doing so will
update all information about the API in the Gateway.  However, if the API is *not* Public, then
the API will be immutable - therefore in order to make any changes you will need to create a new
version of the API.

==== API Metrics
Once an API is published and is being consumed at runtime, metrics information about that usage is
recorded in a metrics storage system.  See the Metrics section of the API Gateway documentation for
more about how and when metrics data is recorded.

If an API has been used by at least once, then it will have metrics information available.
This information can be viewed in the 'Metrics' tab on the API's details page.  On this page
you can choose the type of metric you wish to see (e.g. Usage metrics and Response Type
metrics) as well as a pre-defined time range (e.g. Last 30 Days, Last Week, etc...).

The API Metrics page is a great way to figure out how often your API is used, and in what
ways.

==== Importing API(s)
As an alternative to manually creating and configuring an API, apiman also supports importing
an API from a globally configured API Catalog.

TIP: The API Catalog is configured by the apiman system administrator/installer.  See the
installation guide for more information about how to configure a custom API Catalog.

An API can be imported into apiman in one of two ways.  First, from the Organization's "APIs"
tab you can click the down-arrow next to the "New API" button and choose the "Import API(s)"
option.  This results in a wizard that will guide you through importing one or more API
from the catalog into the Organization.  This wizard will allow you to search for, find, and
select multiple APIs.  It will then walk you through choosing your Plans or making the
APIs "Public". Once all the wizard pages are completed, you can then import the API(s).

TIP: The Import API(s) wizard above is the only way to import multiple APIs at the same time.

Another option for importing an API from the catalog is to use the API Catalog Browser UI,
which can be found by clicking the "Browse available/importable APIs" link on the API Manager
Dashboard.  This link will open the catalog browser, allowing you to search for APIs to
import.  The catalog browser is a friendlier interface, but only allows you to import a
single API at a time.

=== Consuming APIs
After the API providers have added a number of APIs to the API management system, those APIs
can be consumed by Client Apps. This section explains how to consume APIs.

==== Consuming Public APIs
If you have marked an API as "Public", then consuming it is a simple matter of sending a request to the
appropriate API Gateway endpoint.  The managed API endpoint may vary depending on the Gateway being
used, but it typically of the following form:

* http://gatewayhost:port/apiman-gateway/{organizationId}/{apiId}/{version}/

Simply send requests to the managed API endpoint, and do not include an API Key.

TIP: The managed endpoint URL can be easily determined in the UI by navigating to the
"Endpoint" tab on the API details UI page.

==== Creating a Client App
In order to consume an API that is not "Public" you must first create a client app. Client Apps must
exist within the context of an organization. If an organization does not yet exist for this purpose,
simply create a new organization. See the section above on 'Managing Organizations' for more information.

To create a new Client App click the 'Create a New Client App' link on the dashboard page. On the resulting
page provide a client app name, version, and description and then click the 'Create Client App' button. If
the client app is successfully created, you will be taken to the client app details page.

TIP: You can also create a Client App within an Organization by going to the Organization's "Client Apps"
tab and clicking the "New Client App" button.

==== Creating API Contracts
The primary action taken when configuring a client app is the creation of Contracts to APIs. This is
what we mean when we say "consuming an API". There are a number of ways to create API contracts. This
section will describe the most useful of these options.

From the Client App details page, you can find an API to consume by clicking on the 'Search for APIs to consume'
link in the top section of the page. You will be taken to a page that will help you search for and find the
API you wish to consume.

Use the controls on this page to search for an API. Once you have found the API you are interested in,
click on its name in the search results area. This will take you to the API details page for API
consumers. The consumer-oriented API details page presents you with all of the information necessary to
make a decision about how to consume the API. It includes a list of all the API versions and a list
of all of the available plans the API can be consumed through.

Note that you can click on an individual plan to see the details of the policies that will be enforced should
that plan be chosen. Click on the 'Create Contract' button next to the plan you wish to use when consuming
this API. You will be taken to the new contract page to confirm that you want to create an API
contract to this API through the selected plan. If you are sure this is the API contract you wish to
create, click the 'Create Contract' button and then agree to the terms and conditions. If successful, you
will be taken to the 'Contracts' tab on the client app details page.

From the 'Contracts' tab on the client app details page you can see the list of API contracts already
created for this client app. It is also possible to break API contracts from this same list by clicking
an appropriate 'Break Contract' button.

==== API Definition Information
If An API provider has included An API Definition for the API they are providing, you will be
presented with an additional link on the consumer-oriented API details page labeled "API Definition".
This link will take you to a page where you can browse the detailed documentation for the API.  The
detailed documentation should be very helpful in learning what resources and operations are
supported by the API, which will aid in figuring out how precisely to consume the API.

==== Managing Policies
Just like plans and APIs, client apps can have configured policies. The 'Policies' tab will present a
list of all the policies configured for this client app. To add another policy to the client app click the
'Add Policy' button. On the resulting page choose the type of policy you wish to create and then configure
the details for that policy. Once you have configured the details click the 'Add Policy' button to add the
policy to the client app.

Of course, just like for Plans and APIs, you can manage the Client App policies from the 'Policies' tab.
This allows you to not only add new policies but also edit, remove, and reorder them.

==== Registering in the Gateway
After at least one API contract has been created for the client app, it is possible to register the
client app with the runtime gateway. Until the client app is registered with the runtime gateway, it is
not possible to make requests to back-end APIs on behalf of that client app.

To register the client app with the gateway, simply click the "Register" button at the top of the Client
App details UI page (any tab).  If the status of the client app is "Ready", then the 'Register' button
should be enabled.  If successful, the client app status will change to "Registered", and the 'Register'
button will disappear.

Once the client app is registered, you can continue to make changes to it (such as modify its policies
or create/break API Contracts).  If you do make any changes, then the 'Re-Register' button will become
enabled.  Whenever you make changes to your Client App, you *must* Re-Register it before those changes
will show up in the Gateway.

==== Live API Endpoints
After a client app has been registered with the runtime gateway, it is possible to send requests to the
back-end APIs on behalf of that client app (through the client app's API contracts). To do this
you must know the URL of the managed API.  This URL 'optionally' includes the API Key generated for the 
Client App.

To view a list of all of these managed endpoints, navigate to the 'APIs' tab on the API detail page. Each
API contract is represented in the list of managed endpoints. You can expand an entry in the managed
API endpoints table by clicking the '>' icon in the first column.  The resulting details will help you
figure out the appropriate endpoint to use for a particular managed API.

TIP: There are two ways to pass the API Key to the Gateway when you make a request for a Managed
Endpoint.  You can either include the API Key in the URL as a query parameter, or you can pass it
via the *X-API-Key* HTTP header.

=== Versioning
Many of the entities in the API Manager support multiple simultaneous versions.  These include the
following:

* Plans
* APIs
* Client Apps

Typically once an entity is frozen (e.g. Locked or Published) it can no longer be
modified.  But often as things change, modifications to the API Management configuration are necessary.
For example, as an API implementation evolves, the policies associated with it in the API Manager
may need to change.  Versioning allows this to happen, by providing a way for a user to create a new
version of a particular API (or Client App or Plan) and then making changes to it.

To create a new version of an entity, view the details of the entity and click the "New Version" button
in the UI.  This will allow you to make a new version of the entity.  You can either make a simple,
empty new version or you can make a clone of an existing version.  The latter is typically more
convenient when making incremental changes.

TIP:  "Public" APIs and Client Apps can be modified and re-published (or re-registered) in the
Gateway without the need to create a new version.

=== System Administration
There are several "global" settings that must be configured/managed by an apiman administrator.  These
global settings are managed by navigating to the *System Administration* section of the API Manager UI.

==== Roles
Users must become a member of an organization before being allowed to manage any of the plans, APIs,
or client apps contained within it.  When a user is made a member of an organization, they are granted
a specific role within that organization.  Typical examples of roles are *Organization Owner*, *API
Provider*, and *Client App Developer*.  These roles each grant different specific privileges to the
user.  For example, a user with the *Client App Developer* role will be able to manage the organization's
client apps but not its APIs or plans.

The roles that are available when adding a member to an organization are managed in the *Roles* section
of the *System Administration* UI.  The apiman admin can create as many roles as she wishes, giving
each one a name, description, and the set of permissions it grants.  Additionally, certain roles may be
automatically granted to users who create new organizations.  At least one such role must be present,
otherwise organizations cannot be created.

==== Policy Definitions
The policies available when configuring APIs, Plans, and Client Apps are controlled by the *Policy
Definitions* known to apiman.  These definitions are stored in the API Manager and are added by the
apiman admin.  Typically these are added once and rarely changed.  But as new versions of apiman are
released, additional policies will be made available.  For each policy, a policy definition must be
configured in the *System Administration* UI.

Additionally, it is possible for a plugin, when installed, to contribute one or more policy
definitions to the list.  This is a very common way for new policy definitions to be added to
apiman.

==== Gateways
Apiman allows multiple logical Gateways to be configured.  The Gateway is the server that actually applies
the policies configured in the API Manager to live requests to managed APIs.  When using apiman, at
least one Gateway must be running and configured in the API Manager.  However, there is no limit to the
total number of Gateways that may be running.  The typical reason to have multiple Gateways is when
some APIs are very high volume and others are not.  In this case, the high volume APIs could be
published to a Gateway that can handle such load, while the low volume APIs could be published to
another (perhaps cheaper) Gateway.

Another reason you may want multiple Gateways if if you need some of your APIs to be provided in
a particular physical region and others in a different one.  In this case, you may have a Gateway
(perhaps clustered) running in a US data center, while another Gateway (different cluster) is
running separately in a data center in Europe.

In all cases, the apiman admin must configure these Gateways in the *System Administration* UI.  Each
Gateway has a name, description, and configuration endpoint.  The configuration endpoint is what the
API Manager will use when publishing APIs and client apps into the Gateway.

When configuring an API Gateway you will need to include the authentication credentials required to
invoke the API Gateway configuration REST API.  Typically this user must have the 'apipublisher' role
in order to successfully talk to the API Gateway.  The Gateway UI includes a *Test Gateway* button
which will attempt to contact the Gateway API with the credentials included.  If successful, the
test button will turn green.  If unsuccessful, details about the failure will be displayed and the
test button will turn red.

==== Plugins
Apiman supports contributing additional functionality via a powerful plugin mechanism.  Plugins can be
managed by an administrator within the API Manager UI.  The plugin management administration page allows
an admin to install and uninstall plugins.

===== Adding Plugins
The Plugin admin page has two tabs - one shows the list of plugins currently installed, and the
other shows a list of "Available Plugins".  The list of available plugins comes from a plugin
registry that is configured when apiman is installed (see the Installation Guide for details
on how to configure a custom plugin registry).  By default, the "official" apiman plugins will
show up in the list.

A custom plugin is typically added by clicking on the 'Add Custom Plugin' button found on the
"Available Plugins" tab.  This allows you to install a plugin that is not found in the configured
plugin registry.  When installing a custom plugin, you must provide the "coordinates" of the plugin.
All plugins are actually maven artifacts, and as such their coordinates consist of the following
maven properties:

* Group ID
* Artifact ID
* Version
* Classifier (optional)
* Type (optional, defaults to 'war')

When installing a plugin from the plugin registry, simply locate it in the list shown on the
"Available Plugins" tab and then click the "Install" action.  This will again take you to the
Add Plugin page, but with all of the appropriate information already filled in.  At this point
you should only need to click the "Add Plugin" button.

Plugins primarily are used to contribute custom policies to apiman.  These policies are automatically
discovered (if they exist in the plugin) when a plugin is added to the API Manager.  Policies that
have been contributed via a plugin will appear in the Policy Definitions admin page along with the
built-in policies.

===== Uninstalling Plugins
At any time you may choose to uninstall a plugin.  Note that if the plugin was contributing one
or more policies to apiman, then the policy will no longer be available for use when configuring
your Plans, APIs, and Client Apps.  However, if the policy is already in use by one of these
entities, it will continue to work.  In other words, uninstalling a plugin only removes the policy
for use by new entities, it does *not* break existing usages.

To uninstall a plugin, simply click the "Uninstall" action for the appropriate plugin on the 
"Installed Plugins" tab (it is likely represented as a button with a little X).  After confirming 
the action, the plugin should disappear from the list.

===== Upgrading Plugins
If apiman determines that a plugin can be upgraded, then an "Upgrade Plugin" action button will
show up for the plugin in the "Installed Plugins" tab.  This action will be represented as an
up arrow icon button.  When clicked, you will be prompted for the version of the plugin you wish
to upgrade *to*.  The result will be that a new version of the plugin will be downloaded and
installed, replacing the older version you had before.  Note that any Plans, APIs, or Client
Apps that were using the old version of the plugin's policies will *continue* to use the older
version.  However, any new policies from the plugin added to entities will use the new version.
In order to upgrade an existing entity to a newer policy, you will need to remove the old
policy from that entity and re-add it.  We recommend that you only do this if there is a
compelling reason (e.g. a bug is fixed or a new feature added).

==== Export/Import Data
Apiman has a feature that allows an admin user to Export and/or Import data.  You can access this
feature by clicking the "Export/Import Data" link on the API Manager Dashboard page (admin only).
This feature is useful for the following use-cases:

* Backing up data
* Migrating data between environments (e.g. Test->Production)
* Upgrading between apiman versions

From the Export/Import UI page, simply click the "Export All" button if you wish to export all
of the data in the API Manager.  The result will be a downloaded JSON file containing all of
your apiman data.  This file can then be optionally post-processed (perhaps you want to migrate only
a single Organization from your Test environment to your Prod environment).  At some later time,
you can import this file (typically into a different installation of apiman) by selecting it and
choosing "Upload File".

== API Gateway
The runtime layer of apiman consists of a small, lightweight and embeddable API Gateway, which is responsible
for applying the policies configured in the API Manager to all requests to managed APIs.  By default
apiman comes with a WAR version of the API Gateway.  Additionally, there is an asynchronous version of
the API Gateway that runs on the vert.x platform.

=== Configuration
The API Gateway is a completely separate component from the API Manager, and can therefore be used
completely standalone if desired.  However, the API Manager provides a great deal of management functionality
(along with a user interface) that is quite useful.  The API Gateway has a simple REST API that is used
to configure it.  The API provides the following basic capabilities:

* Publish an API
* Register a Client App (with API Contracts)
* Retire an API
* Unregister a Client App

Typically the API Manager is used to manage the configuration of various APIs and client apps
within the scope of one or more Organizations.  At various times during the management of these
entities, the user of the API Manager will 'Publish' an API or 'Register' a Client App.  When this
action occurs, the API Manager invokes one of the relevant API Gateway configuration endpoints listed
above.

=== Invoking Managed APIs
Once appropriate configuration has been published/registered with the API Gateway (see the Configuration
section above), the API Gateway can be used to make managed calls to the APIs it knows about.  A
managed API can be invoked as though the back-end API were being invoked directly, with the
exception that the endpoint is obviously different.  The specific endpoint to use in order to invoke
a particular API can be different based on the Gateway implementation.  However, typically the
endpoint format is:

* http://gatewayhost:port/apiman-gateway/{organizationId}/{apiId}/{version}/

Note that all path segments beyond the {version} segment will be proxied on to the back-end
API endpoint.  Additionally, all HTTP headers and all query parameters (except for the
API Key) will also be proxied to the back-end API.

Requests to managed endpoints may include the API Key so that the Gateway knows which Client App
is being used to invoke the API.  The API Key can be sent in one of the following ways:

* As an HTTP Header named *X-API-Key*
* As a URL query parameter named *apikey*

If the API being invoked is a "Public" API, then no API Key should be sent.  However,
the request should still be sent to the same endpoint as described above.  The endpoint
itself contains enough information to let the Gateway know what API is being invoked.

If an API is not "Public" and you ommit the API Key, then the request will fail.

=== Recording Metrics
The API Gateway is typically configured to record each request made to it into a metrics
storage system of some kind.  By default apiman will use an included elasticsearch
instance to store this information.  Various pieces of information about each request
is included in the record, including but not necessarily limited to the following:

* Request start and end times
* API start and end times (i.e. just the part of the request taken up by the back end API)
* Resource path
* Response type (success, failure, error)
* API info (org id, id, version)
* Client App info (org id, id, version)

This information is then available for analysis and reporting.  The data can be accessed
in a number of ways, including:

* Through the API Manager UI
* Through the API Manager REST API
* Directly from the metrics system

== Policies
The most important runtime concept in apiman is the policy.  Policies are configured in the
API Manager and then applied at runtime by the API Gateway.  This section of the guide provides
more information about each of the policies available in apiman, what they do, and how they
can be configured.

=== Security Policies

==== BASIC Authentication Policy
[[policy-basic-auth]]
===== Description
This policy enables HTTP BASIC Authentication on an API.  In other words, you can use this 
policy to require clients to provide HTTP BASIC authentication credentials when making requests
to the managed API.

TIP: This is a built-in policy and therefore no plugins need to be installed prior to using it.

===== Configuration
The BASIC Authentication policy has a number of configuration options.  There are several
top level configuration properties:

* *realm* (string) : defines the BASIC Auth realm that will be used when responding with an auth challenge (when authentication is missing or fails)
* *forwardIdentityHttpHeader* (string) : if authentication succeeds, indicates the name of an HTTP header to send with the principal/identity of the authenticated user (useful when the back-end API needs to know the identify of the authenticated user)
* *requireTransportSecurity* (boolean) : set to true if this policy should fail when receiving a message over an unsecured communication channel (in other words, enabling this will require clients to use *https*)
* *requireBasicAuth* (boolean) : set to true if BASIC authentication credentials are *required* (set to false if alternative authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth, are also supported)

Additionally, one of the following complex properties must be included in the configuration,
indicating whether apiman should use JDBC, LDAP, or Static (not recommended for production)
information as the source of identity used to validate provided user credentials.

* *jdbcIdentity* (object) : included when you wish to use JDBC to connect to a database containing user and password information
** *type* (enum) : what type of JDBC connection to use - options are 'datasource', 'url'
** *datasourcePath* (string) : the JNDI path of the datasource to use (only when type is 'datasource')
** *jdbcUrl* (string) : the URL to the JDBC database (only when type is 'url')
** *username* (string) : the Username to use when connecting to the JDBC database (only when type is 'url')
** *password* (string) : the Passowrd to use when connecting to the JDBC database (only when type is 'url')
** *query* (string) : the SQL query to use when searching for a user record - the first parameter passed to the query will be the username, the second parameter will be the (optionally hashed) password
** *hashAlgorithm* (enum) : the hashing algorithm used when storing the password data in the database
** *extractRoles* (boolean) : set to true if you also want to extract role information from the database
** *roleQuery* (string) : a SQL query to use when extracting role information - the first parameter passed to the query will be the username
* *ldapIdentity* (object) : included when you wish to connect to LDAP when validating user credentials
** *url* (string) : the URL to the LDAP server
** *dnPattern* (string) : the pattern to use when binding to the LDAP server (you can use ${username} in this pattern)
** *bindAs* (enum) : whether to bind directly to LDAP as the authenticating user (UserAccount), or instead to bind as a service account and then search LDAP for the user's record (ServiceAccount)
** *credentials* (object) : an object with two properties: 'username' and 'password' - credentials used when initially binding to LDAP as a service account
** *userSearch* (object) : an object with two properties: 'baseDn' and 'expression' - used to search for the user's LDAP record so that it can be used to re-bind to LDAP with the appropriate password
** *extractRoles* (boolean) : set to true if you wish to extract role information from LDAP
** *membershipAttribute* (string) : the attribute representing the user's membership in a group - each value should be a reference to another LDAP node
** *rolenameAttribute* (string) : the attribute on a role LDAP node that represents the name of the role
* *staticIdentity* (object) : used mostly for testing purposes - allows you to provide a static set of user names and passwords (do not use in production!)

===== Sample Configuration (LDAP)
Here is an example of the JSON configuration you might use when configuring a
BASIC Authentication policy that uses LDAP to validate the inbound credentials:
```json
{
   "realm" : "Example",
   "forwardIdentityHttpHeader" : "X-Identity",
   "requireTransportSecurity" : true,
   "requireBasicAuth" : true,
   "ldapIdentity" : {
      "url" : "ldap://example.org",
      "dnPattern" : "cn=${username},dc=example,dc=org",
      "bindAs" : "UserAccount",
      "extractRoles" : true,
      "membershipAttribute" : "memberOf",
      "rolenameAttribute" : "objectGUID"
   }
}
```

===== Sample Configuration (JDBC)
Here is an example of the JSON configuration you might use when configuring a
BASIC Authentication policy that uses JDBC to validate the inbound credentials:
```json
{
   "realm" : "Example",
   "forwardIdentityHttpHeader" : "X-Identity",
   "requireTransportSecurity" : true,
   "requireBasicAuth" : true,
   "jdbcIdentity" : {
      "type" : "url",
      "jdbcUrl" : "jdbc:h2:mem:UserDB",
      "username" : "dbuser",
      "password" : "dbpass123#",
      "query" : "SELECT * FROM users WHERE userid = ? AND pass = ?",
      "hashAlgorithm" : "SHA1",
      "extractRoles" : true,
      "roleQuery" : "SELECT r.rolename FROM roles r WHERE r.user = ?"
   }
```


==== Authorization Policy
[[policy-authorization]]
===== Description
This policy enables fine grained authorization to API resources based on authenticated user roles.  This
policy can be used to control precisely who (authenticated users) are allowed to access the API, at an
arbitrarily fine-grained level.

TIP: This is a built-in policy and therefore no plugins need to be installed prior to using it.

===== Configuration
The configuration of this policy consists of a number of rules that are applied to any inbound request
to the API.  Each rule consists of a regular expression pattern, an HTTP verb, and the role that an
authenticated user must possess in order for access to be granted.

TIP: It's *very* important to note that this policy must be configured *after* one of the standard 
apiman authentication policies (e.g. the BASIC Authentication policy or the Keycloak OAuth Policy).
The reason is that an Authentication policy is responsible for extracting the authenticated user's 
roles, which is data that is required for the Authorization Policy to do its work.

* *rules* (array) : Array of rules - each rule is applied only if it matches the current request.
** *pathPattern* (string regexp) : Pattern that must match the request resource path you'd like the policy to be applicable to.
** *verb* (string) : The HTTP verb that must match the request you'd like the policy to be applicable to.
** *role* (string) : The role the user must have if this pattern matches the request.
* *multimatch* (boolean) : Should the request pass when any or all of the authorization rules pass?  Set to true if all rules must match, false if only one rule must match.
* *requestUnmatched* (boolean) : If the request does not match any of the authorization rules, should it pass or fail?  Set to true if you want the policy to *pass* when no rules are matched.

===== Sample Configuration
```json
{
   "rules" : [
   	{
   		"pathPattern": "/admin/.*",
   		"verb": "*",
   		"role": "admin"
   	},
   	{
   		"pathPattern": "/.*",
   		"verb": "GET",
   		"role": "user"
   	}
   ],
   "multiMatch": true,
   "requestUnmatched": false
}
```


==== SOAP Authorization Policy
[[policy-soap-authorization]]
===== Description
This policy is nearly identical to our Authorization Policy, with the exception that it accepts a SOAPAction in the HTTP header. Please note that this policy will only accept a single SOAPAction header, and will not extract the operation name from the SOAP body.

===== Plugin
```json
{
	"groupId": "io.apiman.plugins",
	"artifactId": "apiman-plugins-soap-authorization-policy",
	"version": "1.2.4.Final" // Please check for the latest version, this is just an example.
}
```

===== Configuration
Just as with the Authorization policy, you can define any number of rules you'd like.

* *rules* (array) : A single rule that your policy will apply if each of the following properties match:
** *pathPattern* (string) : Defines the path you'd like the policy to be applicable to.
** *action* (string) : Defines the SOAPAction you'd like the policy to be applicable to.
** *role* (string) : The role the user must have if this pattern matches the request.
* *multiMatch* (boolean) : Should the request pass when any or all of the authorization rules pass?  Set to true if all rules must match, false if only one rule must match.
* *requestUnmatched* (boolean) : If the request does not match any of the authorization rules, should it pass or fail?  Set to true if you want the policy to *pass* when no rules are matched.


===== Sample Configuration
```json
{
   "rules" : [
   	{
   		"pathPattern": "/admin/.*",
   		"action": "hello",
   		"role": "admin"
   	},
   	{
   		"pathPattern": "/",
   		"action": "goodbye",
   		"role": "user"
   	}
   ],
   "multiMatch": true,
   "requestUnmatched": false
}
```


==== IP Whitelist Policy
[[policy-ip-whitelist]]
===== Description
The IP Whitelist Policy Type is the counterpart to the IP Blacklist Policy type. In the IP Whitelist policy, only inbound API requests from Client Apps, policies, or APIs that satisfy the policy are accepted. 

The IP Blacklist and IP Whitelist policies are complementary, but different, approaches to limiting access to an API:
* The IP Blacklist policy type is exclusive in that you must specify the IP address ranges to be excluded from being able to access the API. Any addresses that you do not explicitly exclude from the policy are able to access the API.
* The IP Whitelist policy type is inclusive in that you must specify the IP address ranges to be included to be able to access the API. Any addresses that you do not explicitly include are not able to access the API.

TIP: This is a built-in policy and therefore no plugins need to be installed prior to using it.

===== Configuration
The configuration parameters for an IP Whitelist Policy are:

* *ipList* (array) : The IP address(es), and/or ranges of addresses that will be allowed to access the API. 
* *responseCode* (int) : The server response code. The possible values for the return code are:
 ** 500 - Server error
 ** 404 - Not found
 ** 403 - Authentication failure
* *httpHeader* (string) [optional] : Tells apiman to use the IP address found in the given HTTP request header *instead* of the one associated with the incoming TCP socket.  Useful when going through a proxy, often the value of this is 'X-Forwarded-For'.

===== Sample Configuration
```json
{
  "ipList" : ["192.168.3.*", "192.168.4.*"],
  "responseCode" : 403,
  "httpHeader" : "X-Forwarded-For"
}
```

==== IP Blacklist Policy
[[policy-ip-blacklist]]
===== Description
As its name indicates, the IP blacklist policy type blocks access to an API's resources based on the IP address of the client application. The apiman Management UI form used to create an IP blacklist policy enables you to use wildcard characters in specifying the IP addresses to be blocked. In addition, apiman gives you the option of specifying the return error code sent in the response to the client if a request is denied. Note that an IP Blacklist policy in a plan overrides the an IP Whitelist policy in the same plan.

TIP: This is a built-in policy and therefore no plugins need to be installed prior to using it.

===== Configuration
The configuration parameters for an IP Blacklist Policy are:

* *ipList* (array) : The IP address(es), and/or ranges of addresses that will be blocked from accessing the API. 
* *responseCode* (int) : The server response code. The possible values for the return code are:
 ** 500 - Server error
 ** 404 - Not found
 ** 403 - Authentication failure
* *httpHeader* (string) [optional] : Tells apiman to use the IP address found in the given HTTP request header *instead* of the one associated with the incoming TCP socket.  Useful when going through a proxy, often the value of this is 'X-Forwarded-For'.

===== Sample Configuration
```json
{
  "ipList" : ["192.168.7.*"],
  "responseCode" : 500,
  "httpHeader" : "X-Forwarded-For"
}
```

==== Ignored Resources Policy
[[policy-ignored-resources]]
===== Description
The ignored resources policy type enables you to shield some of an API's resources from being accessed, without blocking access to all the API's resources. Requests made to access to API resources designated as “ignored” result in an HTTP 404 (“not found”) error code. By defining ignored resource policies, apiman enables you to have fine-grained control over which of an API's resources are accessible.

For example, let's say that you have an apiman managed API that provides information to remote staff.  The REST resources provided by this API are structured as follows:

/customers
/customers/{customer id}/orders
/customers/{customer id}/orders/bad_debts

By setting up multiple ignored resource policies, these policies can work together to give you more flexibility in how you govern access to to your API's resources. What you do is to define multiple plans, and in each plan, allow differing levels of access, based on the paths (expressed as regular expressions)defined, for resources to be ignored. To illustrate, using the above examples:

[width="75%",options="header"]
|==========================
| This Path                      | Results in these Resources Being Ignored 
| (empty)                        | Access to all resources is allowed
| /customers                     | Denies access to all customer information
| /customers/.*/orders           | Denies access to all customer order information
| /customers/.*/orders/bad_debts | Denies access to all customer bad debt order information
|==========================

What happens when the policy is applied to an API request is that the apiman Gateway matches the configured paths to the requested API resources. If any of the exclusion paths match, the policy triggers a failure with an HTTP return code of 404.

The IP-related policy types are less fine-grained in that they allow or block access to all of an API's resources based on the IP address of the client application. We'll look at these policy types next.

TIP: This is a built-in policy and therefore no plugins need to be installed prior to using it.

===== Configuration
The configuration parameters for an Ignored Resources Policy are:
* *rules* (array of objects) : The list of matching rules representing the resources to be ignored.
** *verb* (enum) : The HTTP verb to be controlled by the rule. Valid values are:
*** * (matches all verbs)
*** GET
*** POST
*** PUT
*** DELETE
*** OPTIONS
*** HEAD
*** TRACE
*** CONNECT
** *pathPattern* (string regexp) : A regular expression used to match the REST resource being hidden.

===== Sample Configuration
```json
{
  "rules" : [
    { "verb" : "GET",  "pathPattern" : "/customers" },
    { "verb" : "POST", "pathPattern" : "/customers/.*/orders" },
    { "verb" : "*",    "pathPattern" : "/customers/.*/orders/bad_debts"}
  ]
}
```

==== Time Restricted Access Policy
[[policy-time-restricted-access]]
===== Description
This policy is used to only allow access to an API during certain times.  In fact, the policy can
be configured to apply different time restrictions to different API resources (matched via 
regular expressions).  This allows you to control *when* client and users are allowed to access 
your API.

TIP: This is a built-in policy and therefore no plugins need to be installed prior to using it.

===== Configuration
The configuration parameters for a Time Restricted Access Policy are:
* *rules* (array of objects) : The list of matching rules representing the resources being controlled and the time ranges they are allowed to be accessed.
** *timeStart* (time) : Indicates the time of day (UTC) to begin allowing access.
** *timeEnd* (time) : Indicates the time of day (UTC) to stop allowing access.
** *dayStart* (integer) : Indicates the day of week (1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, etc) to begin allowing access.
** *dayEnd* (integer) : Indicates the day of week (1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, etc) to stop allowing access.
** *pathPattern* (string regexp) : A regular expression used to match the request's resource path/destination.  The time restriction will be applied only when the request's resource matches this pattern.

TIP: If none of the configured rules matches the request resource path/destination, then no rules will be applied and the request will succeed.

===== Sample Configuration
```json
{
    "rules": [
        {
            "timeStart": "12:00:00",
            "timeEnd": "20:00:00",
            "dayStart": 1,
            "dayEnd": 5,
            "pathPattern": "/path/to/.*"
        },
        {
            "timeStart": "10:00:00.000Z",
            "timeEnd": "18:00:00.000Z",
            "dayStart": 1,
            "dayEnd": 7,
            "pathPattern": "/other/path/.*"
        }
    ]
}```

==== URL Whitelist Policy
[[policy-url-whitelist]]
===== Description
This policy allows users to explicitly allow only certain API subpaths to be accessed.  It's
particularly useful when only a small subset of resources from a back-end API should be 
exposed through the managed endpoint.

===== Plugin
```json
{
	"groupId": "io.apiman.plugins",
	"artifactId": "apiman-plugins-url-whitelist-policy",
	"version": "1.2.4.Final" // Please check for the latest version, this is just an example.
}
```

===== Configuration
Configuration of the URL Whitelist Policy consists of a property to control the stripping
of the managed endpoint prefix, and then a list of items representing the endpoint paths that
are allowed.

* *removePathPrefix* (boolean) : Set to true if you want the managed endpoint prefix to be stripped out before trying to match the request path to the whitelisted items (this is typically set to 'true').
* *whitelist* (array of objects) : A list of items, where each item represents an API sub-resource that should be allowed.
** *regex* (string) : Regular expression to match the API sub-resource path (e.g. /foo/[0-9]/bar)
** *methodGet* (boolean) : True if http GET should be allowed (default *false*).
** *methodPost* (boolean) :True if http POST should be allowed (default *false*).
** *methodPut* (boolean) : True if http PUT should be allowed (default *false*).
** *methodPatch* (boolean) : True if http PATCH should be allowed (default *false*).
** *methodDelete* (boolean) : True if http DELETE should be allowed (default *false*).
** *methodHead* (boolean) : True if http HEAD should be allowed (default *false*).
** *methodOptions* (boolean) : True if http OPTIONS should be allowed (default *false*).
** *methodTrace* (boolean) : True if http TRACE should be allowed (default *false*).

===== Sample Configuration
```json
{
    "removePathPrefix" : true,
    "whitelist" : [
        {
            "regex" : "/admin/.*",
            "methodGet" : true,
            "methodPost" : true
        },
        {
            "regex" : "/users/.*",
            "methodGet" : true,
            "methodPost" : true,
            "methodPut" : true,
            "methodDelete" : true
        }
    ]
}
```


=== Limiting Policies
Some apiman policies provide an all-or-nothing level of control over access to managed APIs. For example, IP Blacklist or Whitelist policies either block or enable all access to a managed API, based on the IP address of the client. Rate limiting and quota policies provide you with more flexible ways to govern access to managed APIs. With rate limiting and quota policies, you can place limits on either the number of requests an API will accept over a specified period of time, or the total number of of bytes in the API requests. In addition, you can use combinations of fine-grained and coarse-grained rate limiting policies together to give you more flexibility in governing access to your managed API.

The ability to throttle API requests based on request counts and bytes transferred provides even greater flexibility in implementing policies. APIs that transfer larger amounts of data, but rely on fewer API requests can have that data transfer throttled on a per byte basis. For example, an API that is data intensive, will return a large amount of data in response to each API request. The API may only receive a request a few hundreds of times a day, but each request may result in several megabytes of data being transferred. Let's say that we want to limit the amount of data transferred to 6GB per hour. For this type of API, we could set a rate limiting policy to allow for one request per minute, and then augment that policy with a transfer quota policy of 100Mb per hour.

Each of these policies, if used singly, can be effective in throttling requests. apiman, however, adds an additional layer of flexibility to your use of these policy types by enabling you to use them in combinations.

apiman supports these types of limiting policies:

* Rate Limiting Policy
* Quota Policy
* Transfer Quota Policy

==== Rate Limiting Policy
[[policy-rate-limiting]]
===== Description

The Rate Limiting Policy type governs the number of times requests are made to an API within a specified time period. The requests can be filtered by user, application, or API and can set the level of granularity for the time period to second, minute, hour, day, month, or year. The intended use of this policy type is for fine grained processing (e.g., 10 requests per second).

TIP: This is a built-in policy and therefore no plugins need to be installed prior to using it.

===== Configuration
The configuration parameters for a Rate Limiting Policy are:

* *limit* (integer) : This is the number of requests that must be received before the policy will trigger.
* *granularity* (enum) : The apiman element for which the requests are counted. Valid values are:
** User
** Api
** Client
* *period* : The time period over which the policy is applied.  Valid values are:
** Second
** Minute
** Hour
** Day
** Month
** Year
* *headerLimit* (string) [optional] : HTTP response header that apiman will use to store the limit being applied. 
* *headerRemaining* (string) [optional] : HTTP response header that apiman will use to store how many requests remain before the limit is reached.
* *headerReset* (string) [optional] : HTTP response header that apiman will use to store the number of seconds until the limit is reset.

===== Sample Configuration
```json
{
  "limit" : 100,
  "granularity" : "Api",
  "period" : "Minute",
  "headerLimit" : "X-Limit",
  "headerRemaining" : "X-Limit-Remaining",
  "headerReset" : "X-Limit-Reset"
}
```

==== Quota Policy
[[policy-quota]]
===== Description
The Quota Policy type performs the same basic functionality as the Rate Limiting policy type., however, the intended use of this policy type is for less fine grained processing (e.g., 10,000 requests per month).

TIP: This is a built-in policy and therefore no plugins need to be installed prior to using it.

===== Configuration
The configuration parameters for a Quota Policy are:

* *limit* (integer) : This is the number of requests that must be received before the policy will trigger.
* *granularity* (enum) : The apiman element for which the requests are counted. Valid values are:
** User
** Api
** Client
* *period* : The time period over which the policy is applied.  Valid values are:
** Hour
** Day
** Month
** Year
* *headerLimit* (string) [optional] : HTTP response header that apiman will use to store the limit being applied. 
* *headerRemaining* (string) [optional] : HTTP response header that apiman will use to store how many requests remain before the limit is reached.
* *headerReset* (string) [optional] : HTTP response header that apiman will use to store the number of seconds until the limit is reset.

===== Sample Configuration
```json
{
  "limit" : 100000,
  "granularity" : "Client",
  "period" : "Month",
  "headerLimit" : "X-Quota-Limit",
  "headerRemaining" : "X-Quota-Limit-Remaining",
  "headerReset" : "X-Quota-Limit-Reset"
}
```

==== Transfer Quota Policy
[[policy-transfer-quota]]
===== Description
In contrast to the other policy types, Transfer Quota tracks the number of bytes transferred (either uploaded or downloaded) rather than the total number of requests made.

TIP: This is a built-in policy and therefore no plugins need to be installed prior to using it.

===== Configuration
The configuration parameters for a Quota Policy are:

* *direction* (enum) : Indicates whether uploads, downloads, or both directions should count against the limit.  Value values are:
** upload
** download
** both
* *limit* (integer) : This is the number of requests that must be received before the policy will trigger.

=== Modification Policies

==== URL Rewriting Policy
[[policy-url-rewriting]]
===== Description
This policy is used to re-write responses from the back-end API such that they will be modified by 
fixing up any incorrect URLs found with modified ones.  This is useful because apiman works through 
an API Gateway, and in some cases an API might return URLs to followup action or data endpoints.  In
these cases the back-end API will likely be configured to return a URL pointing to the unmanaged API
endpoint.  This policy can fix up those URL references so that they point to the managed API endpoint
(the API Gateway endpoint) instead.

TIP: This is a built-in policy and therefore no plugins need to be installed prior to using it.

===== Configuration
This policy requires some basic configuration, including a regular expression used to match the
URL, as well as a replacement value.

* *fromRegex* (string regex) : A regular expression used to identify a matching URL found in the response.
* *toReplacement* (string) : The replacement URL - regular expression groups identified in the *fromRegex* can be used.
* *processBody* (boolean) : Set to true if URLs should be replaced in the response body.
* *processHeaders* (boolean) : Set to true if URLs should be replaced in the response headers.

TIP: This policy *cannot* be used for any other replacements besides URLs - the policy is implemented
specifically to find and replace valid URLs.  As a result, arbitrary regular expression matching will
not work (the policy scans for URLs and then matches those URLs against the configured regex).  This
is done for performance reasons.

===== Sample Configuration
```json
{
    "fromRegex" : "https?://[^\/]*\/([.\/]*)",
    "toReplacement" : "https://apiman.example.com/$1",
    "processBody" : true,
    "processHeaders" : true

}
```

==== Transformation Policy
[[policy-transformation]]
===== Description
This policy converts an API format between JSON and XML.  If an API is implemented to
return XML, but a client would prefer to receive JSON data, this policy can be used
to automatically convert both the request and response bodies.  In this way, the client
can work with JSON data even though the back-end API requires XML (and responds with 
XML).

Note that this policy is very generic, and does an automatic conversion between XML
and JSON.  For more control over the specifics of the format conversion, a custom 
policy may be a better choice.

===== Plugin
```json
{
    "groupId": "io.apiman.plugins",
    "artifactId": "apiman-plugins-transformation-policy",
    "version": "1.2.4.Final" // Please check for the latest version, this is just an example.
}
```

===== Configuration
The configuration of this policy consists of two properties which indicate:

1. the format required by the client
2. the format required by the back-end server

From these two properties, the policy can decide how (and if) to convert the data.

* *clientFormat* (enum) : The format required by the client, possible values are:  'XML', 'JSON'
* *serverFormat* (enum) : The format required by the server, possible values are:  'XML', 'JSON'

===== Sample Configuration
```json
{
   "clientFormat" : "JSON",
   "serverFormat" : "XML"
}
```

==== JSONP Policy
[[policy-jsonp]]
===== Description
This policy turns a standard REST endpoint into a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP[JSONP] 
compatible endpoint.  For example, a REST endpoint may typically return the following JSON
data:

```json
{
  "foo" : "bar",
  "baz" : 17
}
```

If the JSONP policy is applied to this API, then the caller must provide a JSONP callback
function name via the URL (for details on this, see the *Configuration* section below).
When this is done, the API might respond with this instead:

```json
callbackFunction({
  "foo" : "bar",
  "baz" : 17
})
```

TIP: If the API client does not send the JSONP callback function name in the URL (via the
configured query parameter name), this policy will do nothing.  This allows managed endpoints
to support both standard REST *and* JSONP at the same time.

===== Plugin
```json
{
    "groupId": "io.apiman.plugins",
    "artifactId": "apiman-plugins-jsonp-policy",
    "version": "1.2.4.Final" // Please check for the latest version, this is just an example.
}
```

===== Configuration
The JSONP policy has a single configuration property, which can be used to specify the
name of the HTTP query parameter that the caller must use to pass the name of the
JSONP callback function.

* *callbackParamName* (string) : Name of the HTTP query parameter that should contain the JSONP callback function name.

===== Sample Configuration
```json
{
   "callbackParamName" : "callback"
}
```

If the above configuration were to be used, the API client (caller) must send the JSONP callback
function name in the URL of the request as a query parameter named *callback*.  For example:

```
GET /path/to/resource?callback=myCallbackFunction HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.org
Accept: application/json
```

In this example, the response might look like this:

```json
myCallbackFunction({
  "property1" : "value1",
  "property2" : "value2"
})
```

=== Other Policies

==== Caching Policy
[[policy-caching]]
===== Description
Allows caching of API responses in the Gateway to reduce overall traffic to the back-end API.  The
caching policy is currently very naive and only supports a simple "time-to-live" approach to 
caching.

TIP: This is a built-in policy and therefore no plugins need to be installed prior to using it.

===== Configuration
The caching policy only supports a single configuration options, which is the time to live
in seconds.

* *ttl* (long) : Number of seconds to cache the response.


===== Sample Configuration
```json
{
   "ttl" : 60
}
```


==== Log Policy
[[policy-log]]
===== Description
A policy that logs the headers to standard out.  Useful to analyse inbound HTTP traffic to 
the gateway when added as the first policy in the chain or to analyse outbound HTTP 
traffic from the gateway when added as the last policy in the chain.

===== Plugin
```json
{
    "groupId": "io.apiman.plugins",
    "artifactId": "apiman-plugins-log-policy",
    "version": "1.2.4.Final" // Please check for the latest version, this is just an example.
}
```

===== Configuration
The Log Policy can be configured to output the request headers, the response headers, or 
both.  When configuring this policy via the apiman REST API, there is only property:

* *direction* (enum) : Which direction you wish to log, options are: 'request', 'response', 'both'

===== Sample Configuration
```json
{
   "direction" : "both"
}
```
